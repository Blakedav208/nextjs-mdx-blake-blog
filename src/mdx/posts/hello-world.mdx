First Blog Post!

My name is Blake. I am currently a Student @ BCU. 
I started my journey in late 2020 amidst the global pandemic. 
I began by taking an online Java Programming I course that was offered by the University of Helsinki. 
The course began with the basics of programming and got into some pretty intermediate topics such as polymorphism, sorting algorithms, and a couple basic data structures. 
The course took me a few months to complete because I was learning at a slower than recommeded rate, this was intentional so that I could really learn these fundamental concepts. 
I have Since completed that course and now I have moved onto learning the basics of Web Development through an online resource called 'The Odin Project'.
Web Development has proved to be tricky, but I am motivated to keep learning!
My overall goal with programming is to learn enough to create a thorough portfolio and hopefully to eventually get a job within the Tech career field. 
I hope that you as a reader are able to learn/grow with me and are able to take something away from my blog !
